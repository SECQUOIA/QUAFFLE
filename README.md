# QUAFFLE – Quantum U-Net Assisted Federated Flood Learning and Estimation

**QUAFFLE** is a hybrid quantum–classical framework that combines federated learning and quantum-enhanced U-Net architectures to enable distributed, resource-efficient flood mapping using satellite imagery.

---

##  Highlights

- **Finalist** in NASA’s *Beyond the Algorithm Challenge: Novel Computing Architectures for Flood Analysis*.  
- Efficient federated flood detection across SAR and optical satellite data, with reduced parameter count and improved AUC compared to classical baselines.  
- Compatible with both gate-based and photonic quantum simulators.

##  Architecture and Implementation

- **Quantum U-Net**: Incorporates a variational quantum layer at the U-Net bottleneck for enhanced feature extraction and parameter efficiency.  
- **Federated Learning**: Built upon the Flower framework for distributed collaborative training without centralized data exchange.  
- **Quantum Backends**: Supports PennyLane (gate-based) and ORCA-SDK (photonic) simulations.  
- **Modeling Framework**: Implementation relies on PyTorch for U-Net structure and training workflows.  
- **Datasets**: Evaluated on the IEEE DFC24 SAR and Optical datasets with strong performance.
